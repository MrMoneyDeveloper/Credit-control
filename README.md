Credit Control System - Frontend
Welcome to the Credit Control System repository! This project is dedicated to providing an intuitive and user-friendly front-end interface for managing credit control processes in the City of Ekurhuleni's Solar division. The division operates under the Department of Finance as part of Revenue Collection, ensuring efficient debt control and revenue recovery.

Overview
The Credit Control System is an essential component of the debt control division, facilitating the collection of outstanding debts from debtors who have surpassed their due dates. As a front-end developer, I've focused on creating a responsive and user-centric interface to enhance the overall user experience in navigating and interacting with the system.
